The target (an image the game environment appears over when in view of the camera) would be the image on the swipe card their customers buy, refill, and use at any of their many of their locations.\n\nThe application deliverables:\n\n1. Works across iPad, iPhone, & Android devices. Minimum iPhone 5 and above, iPad Mini 1 and above, Android minimum unspecified.\n2. The UI of the main and loading screens should to be dynamic/animated\n3. Link each social media account they have to a UI button to direct user traffic towards those social media accounts\n4. A button to initiate a call to their customer service number\n5. A map that shows the user's current location, and every branch/location within the bounds of the map\n6. Each location when interacted with (clicked) should present the user with two options;\n-       - Navigate To —> Initiates navigation by opening the Google Maps application, or a page of Google Maps on the primary browser, with the user's current location set to the starting point and the selected location as the destination to make the process of starting the journey effortless for the user.\n-       - View Location —> Opens a 360° degree view, or image gallery if 360° texture unavailable, giving the user an enticing view of the location selected.\n7. Allow users to check the balance of any re-fillable swipe card purchased from any one of their many branches.\n8. An augmented reality game that;\n-       - Is an infinite arcade style game with a theme that reflects, or is closely related and can be associated with, their brand.\n-       -  Initiates the game environment when the front of their branded swipe card is in view of the augmented reality camera over, and according to the scale of, the card.\n-       -  Allow users to convert game points/achievements to redeemable credit on the swipe card (otherwise only available through monetary purchase) which may be used at any of their locations (on rides/rewards/games/etc.).\n-       -  Encrypted and cheat proof.\n-       -  Communicates all redeemed scores, as well as the swipe card account number, to their self-hosted Microsoft SQL databases.\n\nI developed the 360° degree views by shooting an array of photos at each location with a DSLR camera and 180° degree high-end fish-eye lens, cleaned them up as best as I could in photoshop to account for lighting constrains, and then stitched together in a 360° panoramic texture."},"bodyRichText":{"json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[],"nodeType":"hr"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"An application/game that is centered around new/emerging technology to help revive a rather aged, but still well-known and loved, theme-park/arcade chain in the MENA region.
