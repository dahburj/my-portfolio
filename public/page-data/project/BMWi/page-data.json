An often unsustainable national electricity grid, falling component prices and the rapid advancing digitization open up new ways and business models in this sector. This growth is essential for achieving the climate goals. In order to promote the political energy dialogue with the partner countries and the orientation of German companies, this change must be understood and arranged.\n\nTFE Energy has many decades of experience in decentralized energy systems both in Africa and India and has access to a strong network of local energy innovators in these countries.\nTogether with the BMWi, TFE Energy are writing a \"Study on Innovative and Digital Solutions for Decentralized Energy Supply in Africa and Asia Using Case Studies\", which benefits both the BMWi in the political dialogue within the framework of the energy partnerships and also German companies in these new markets and business models.
