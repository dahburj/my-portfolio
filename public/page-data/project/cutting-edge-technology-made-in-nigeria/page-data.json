This data-driven knowledge de-risks projects, reduces time and costs for viable mini-grid planning and investment at scale.\n\nVIDA is a start-up that, we at TFE Energy, are incubating, with a goal to scale mini-grids using Machine Learning algorithms. \nWe are building the technology through our partnership with appliedAI, a division of UnternehmerTUM, the start-up incubator at the Technical University of Munich and one of the largest in Europe. AppliedAI is Germany’s leading non-profit initiative for the application of artificial intelligence. \n"},"files":null,"image":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/nvxmg7jt07o2/60bkkQTqHi9XnKSil45Z1h/161a94ac5ec0c3629c315d5d595f139a/nasa-Q1p7bh3SHj8-unsplash.jpg"}},"tags":["satellite","ESA","AI","machine learning","Africa","Mini-grid"],"type":["Project"]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"cutting-edge-technology-made-in-nigeria","id":"930c15a5-5a3b-5a0e-b003-0859e1bfcef9"}}}
